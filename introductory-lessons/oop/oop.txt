The three basic components of object orientation are;

Object oriented analysis – functionality of the system
Object oriented designing – architecture of the system
Object oriented programming – implementation of the application

Object Oriented Programming Principles
---------------------------------------
1. Encapsulation – this is concerned with hiding the 
implementation details and only exposing the methods.

2. Inheritance – this is concerned with the relationship between 
classes. The relationship takes the form of a parent and child.

3. Polymorphism – this is concerned with having a single form 
but many different implementation ways. The main purpose of polymorphism is;
Simplify maintaining applications and making them more extendable.

OOPs Concepts in PHP
--------------------
PHP is an object oriented scripting language.
The above principles are achieved via;

1. Encapsulation – via the use of “get” and “set” methods etc.
2. Inheritance – via the use of extends keyword
3. Polymorphism – via the use of implements keyword

What is UML?
-------------
Unified Modeling Language UML is a technique used to design 
and document object oriented systems.

* Interface – it is similar to a class. It only defines the methods 
and parameters.
* Abstract class – it is a class that cannot be used to create an 
object directly. Its purpose is to provide partial or whole 
implementations of common methods.
